Audio Vis Starter Project {#audiovisstarterproject}
=========================

Run from a server:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

or

`npm install -g http-server`
`http-server`

Well hello there! Welcome to the audio visualisation starter project!
Allow me to run you through it.

There are three HTML files (see examples folder), each one shows an
example of creating a visualisation in different ways, each has it's own
js file (see scripts folder).

You can create vis in any way you can make things in a browser: HTML &
CSS, SVGs or a `canvas` element. What ever floats your boat.

> NB To have your visualisation run at the *Cool Karaoke Party™* you
> will need to create them with the canvas element example.
